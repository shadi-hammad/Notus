Notus is a weather app designed to retrieve accurate, up-to-the-minute weather data for your location. Notus uses the Dark Sky Forecast API to access weather data from around the world. The app uses GPS services to quickly - and accurately - obtain the user's location. Notus features a straight-forward, simple design to quickly display both current and future weather conditions to the user. Thanks to Places Search from Google Places API for Android, Notus now allows users to search from thousands of cities and receive instantaneous weather information! 

Notus also uses a dynamic background color scheme that automatically matches current weather conditions to give the app a stylish and in-tune feel.
